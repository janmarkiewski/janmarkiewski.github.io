									<p style="color: black;">Laboratory Vassiliki A. Boussiotis, M.D., Ph.D. Professor of Medicine | Boston, Massachusetts</p>
									<b style="color: black;">Mechanisms and Signaling Pathways of T-Cell Responses</b>
									<p style="color: black;">Research student under the guidance of Vassiliki A. Boussiotis, M.D, Ph.D. with over 100
cumulative hours for the purpose of learning laboratory techniques and understanding different
aspects of immunology and tumor immunology.</p>
									<li style="color: black;">Engaged in extensive literature search, focusing on tumor-infiltrating macrophages and monocytes,
Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) and FLT3 ligand (FL), cancer defense mechanisms, and FLT3
signaling in leukemia. Studied cellular components and signaling pathways in the tumor
microenvironment, with a focus on dendritic cells. Researched immune system components,
peripheral lymphoid organs, lymphocyte trafficking, and flow cytometry applications. Additionally,
studied the innate and adaptive immune systems, including humoral and cell-mediated immunity,
and created detailed notes on T and B lymphocytes, their subtypes, and functions.</li>
									<li style="color: black;">Completed PCR training, covering primer selection, pipetting techniques, and DNA analysis.
Assisted in numbering tubes, pipetting buffers, and organizing, weaning, and euthanizing mice.
Conducted gel electrophoresis, including DNA visualization and PCR products.</li>
									<li style="color: black;">Assisted with various mice work, including cage organization, mice separation, shaving, sedation,
and tail cuts. Prepared and helped inject mice, arranged cages, and independently tagged, weaned,
fed, and provided water to mice.</li>
									<li style="color: black;">Documented tumor measurements, assisted in mice euthanasia, and observed tumor takedown
preparations. Observed and assisted in tumor analysis, single cell suspension preparation, cell
counts, plate washing, and centrifugation.</li>
									<li style="color: black;">Understood the principles and foundations of flow cytometry specifically using Cytoflex. Learned
how to perform and understand data analysis, including histogram and dot plot creation,
compensation tools, and gating techniques.</li>
